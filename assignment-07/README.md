With divs and spans, the two main ways that they are different is that one works more vertically and one works more horizontally. Divs make a big chunk in code and also work as a line break, the group up important code going down the page. Spans are in-line and work with small chunks of code usually inside of a paragraph element. Class is used to classify a broad group of elements whereas and id is unique to itself and there's no other id like it.

Alt text or alternative text is very important. It is necessary to have a very clear alt text because it is used for screen readers to describe an image.

For this assignment, I started out by creating my seperate divs and prepping the code so it was easier once I started working inside of it. I had trouble with the audio and video but I found out I was using the wrong link and instead I had to use the embedded link provided. After that problem was solved, I continued to add the copyright, lyrics, and map and finished the webpage.
