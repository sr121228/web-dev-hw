## Questions

13. A document is only allowed to have one <head> and one <body element in order for the page to function properly.

14. Structural markup and semantic markup are two forms of markup used to help build a webpage. Structural markup are the elements that you use to describe both the heading and paragraph element, it builds the foundation. Semantic markup then comes in and allows you to provide extra information such as using things like emphasis <em>, a strong word <strong>, or a blockquote <blockquote>. There is many more semantic markup elements to help customize your page.

15. This assignment was awesome! It was the most fun and most challenging assignment we've had yet! I really enjoyed diving in and doing it mostly ourselves! For my work cycle, I started out making an assignment-05 folder on atom before I started anything else. I then proceeded to make an index.html file where I included all the elements of the page! I struggled a bit with linking the site but it ended up being one little slash that was note deleted that messed all of it up! I then went over the site multiple times and fixed little things and moved them around to make the site look better! I finally finished with creating this README.
