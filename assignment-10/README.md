I am a big fan of simplicity in anything I design whether it's websites or graphic based. So for this project I went with more simplistic fonts that looked great! I chose to use the font called "Raleway" and "Oswald"! I decided to go with a green site because I though it complimented the black and white great!

A system font is a font that is already pre installed on your computer. When you go out and purchase a computer, these are the fonts you will see on all of the programs. A web font is a font that is specially tuned for websites using CSS font-face. Lastly, web safe fonts are fonts that are pre-installed by operating systems that look very similar on the web between different systems and programs.

This project was definitely more of a difficult one for me! It was hard to figure out how fonts correlated with one another and how to get them to appear how I wanted them to on the website. I spent most of my time trying to figure out good, simple fonts that looked well with the colors and the design. Once I figured out the jist of correctly putting the fonts on the website it went really well! I enjoyed taking on the challenge and learning each step as I went through it all!
