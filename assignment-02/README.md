# Assignment 2
## Simon Rooney
I decided to take intro to web design because I have always been interested in coding and the internet. Coding is something that is in everything we use but hardly anyone knows how to use it. With this class, I'm hoping to gain more knowledge on the internet and computers as well as gain all new knowledge on coding and how it works.

* How the interent is connected physically.
* How to code really good.
* Be able to know the signs I use to code certain aspects well.
