This class was absolutely awesome! I learned so much about coding that I never knew before. GitHub was great to work with and it was awesome seeing so many new things I have never seen! Repositories and version controls were also very interesting to see my progress while moving through many different projects! Overall, web development has been so cool and so amazing to learn! An amazing class!

I have always loved the graphical representation of websites and anything related to them. Learning about how I create them was absolutely awesome and seeing these fonts, colors, and media come to life was great. I had no idea how to do any of these things before this class and it taught me so much and showed me how.

This final project was awesome! I got to make it about drumming, which I am very passionate about and care so much for! I started out building the structure of the website with HTML and making my index and other html pages. This part went more smooth then normal due to me practicing so much this semester! When I moved on to the css and style of the website, it also went very good! Adding elements and styles were easier than ever and it was great seeing my final project come together! Thank you for this class and this semester!!
