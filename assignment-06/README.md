## Questions
13. When anyone goes on the web, they come across forms more than they'll ever know! When I go onto google to buy something I search in a form to get to a webpage. Then once on the webpage, I purchase something entering my credit card information in other types of forms and then hitting the "submit" form to finalize all of it.

14. If someone was filling out a scholarship application, they would use all three forms of text, selection, and button input. There would be text boxes to fill out and describe why they deserve the scholarship. Selection inputs for people to select what race, income bracket, and year they are, and lastly, a button input to submit the application.

15. For this assignment, I started out by going through all the steps on the website, learning how to deal with forms and reading the book. When starting the assignment, the first problem I had was with the table. It took me multiple tries to get the border, color, and padding right, but after looking more into it I figured it out. I then decided to go with text boxes and a selection input for my forms. Then finishing it off with a submit button.
