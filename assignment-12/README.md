My imaginary client for this project was a ski brand called "POWDOW." They described their needs as having colors of blue, black, and white. They also wanted the theme of the website to be clean and simple. I tried to do this with simple fonts and a simple color palette that worked great together.

First off, display:block means that the block has some white space above and below the element and it does not allow for any HTML elements next to it. Display:inline means that all the elements are displayed inside the current block on the same line. Lastly, display:inline-block lets you set the width and height of each element of the whole element.

This project was a great one! I really enjoyed having more freedom to create what we wanted to and work through everything on CSS. I started out with an idea for a skiing website and I immedieatley got the colors of blue, white, and black in my head. From there, I proceeded to layout the format of the website through html and get everything set. I then went on to add the style, fonts, and uniqeuness to the page. My biggest trouble was with the dropdown menu but I got help with that so it was great!
