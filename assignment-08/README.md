HTML was such a cool thing for me to learn. I have never done anything with coding in my life so every thing was brand new to me! I though the most interesting part was linking different elements together! The hardest part for me was definiteley trying to find out where I messed up in a big thing of code!

For this assignment, I started out going onto Instructables and finding a project I was interested in! I ended up finding one that related with me and I got very excited! I then started out by reviewing old code and familiarizing myself with what we've done this semester so far! After this, I went on to designing the site, going step by step and putting together the website to the best of my ability while having fun doing it!!
