      <h2>Why Did You Choose This Project?</h2>
      <p>I chose the project to build a wooden table! I did this because back in high school my dad and I built a table for our kitchen. It was a little different than this one, however, when I saw this on instructables it took me back to those moments! That's why I chose it!</p>

      <h2>What Does it Mean For You?</h2>
      <p>This project means so much! Like I said in the previous paragraph, it brings me back to those moments with my dad building our kitchen table! It took us weeks to complete but when it was all done it was well worth it!</p>
